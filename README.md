COVID-19 pandemic caused by coronavirus is 
constantly spreading all over the world. The affect of COVID 
has fallen on almost all development sectors. The healthcare 
system goes through crisis. Measures have been taken to 
prevent the spreading of this virus where wearing a mask is 
one of them. In this paper, we proposed a system that will 
detect people who are not wearing mask where all the public 
places are monitored by CCTV cameras. The face mask 
detection system is developed with a machine learning 
algorithm: MobileNetV1. The steps for building the model are 
collecting the photos of people wearing masks and not wearing 
masks or taking normal images of people and make custom CV 
script to add masks on them , then pre-processing the data and 
splitting the data, testing and then implementing the model.
The model can detect people who are wearing mask or not 
wearing mask at an accuracy ranging 98.71-99.90 percent.
